FIRST principles for testing:
Fast - tests should run fast so it will stay easy to run them often but without
wasting resources.
It is faster to run the tests if there is no application context we need to load.
(minimal spring annotations)

Isolated - independent test that can be run in any arbitrary order.
If some of your test change or delete existing objects - you should counteract it
after the test is done.
If that requires too much effort and it is simply easier to reboot the context - we
can ask that by using the @DirtiesContext annotation.

Repeatable - the same result should be given at every run, not flaky tests

Self-validating - test the results that the actual result is identical to the
expected result.

Timely - test should be written before the code is written, or at least in the
same time.
